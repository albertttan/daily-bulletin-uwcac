### Poem of the Day

> #### After the Winter
> **Claude McKay**
>   
> Some day, when trees have shed their leaves  
> &emsp;And against the morning’s white  
> The shivering birds beneath the eaves  
> &emsp;Have sheltered for the night,  
> We’ll turn our faces southward, love,  
> &emsp;Toward the summer isle  
> Where bamboos spire the shafted grove  
> &emsp;And wide-mouthed orchids smile.
> 
>  And we will seek the quiet hill  
> &emsp;Where towers the cotton tree,  
> And leaps the laughing crystal rill,  
> &emsp;And works the droning bee.  
> And we will build a cottage there  
> &emsp;Beside an open glade,  
> With black-ribbed blue-bells blowing near,  
> &emsp;And ferns that never fade.
