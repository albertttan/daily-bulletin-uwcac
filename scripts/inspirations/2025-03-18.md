> #### The Sea of Sunset
> **Emily Dickinson**
>
> This is the land the sunset washes,  
> These are the banks of the Yellow Sea;  
> Where it rose, or whither it rushes,  
> These are the western mystery!
>
> Night after night her purple traffic  
> Strews the landing with opal bales;  
> Merchantmen poise upon horizons,  
> Dip, and vanish with fairy sails.
