### Poem of the Day

> #### <span style="font-size: smaller;">Excerpt from</span><br>Ending Song
> **Praisley Rekdal**
> 
> &hellip; Oh
> 
> wasn’t that the point  
> of love: to join the end  
> to its beginning, save  
> some semblance of a whole  
> 
> by splitting it to half?  
> Wasn’t that the hope  
> with which he sounded out  
> the weakened wood
> 
> before he cut, the care  
> with which you bound  
> the fallen branches up  
> once he let them go?
