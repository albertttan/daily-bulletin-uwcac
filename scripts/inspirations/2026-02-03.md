### Poem of the Day: US Black History Month Specials 💪🏾

> #### Harlem
> 
> **Langston Hughes**
> 
> What happens to a dream deferred?
> Does it dry up  
> like a raisin in the sun?  
> Or fester like a sore—  
> And then run?  
> Does it stink like rotten meat?  
> Or crust and sugar over—  
> like a syrupy sweet?
> 
> Maybe it just sags  
> like a heavy load.
> 
> *Or does it explode?*
