### Poem of the Day

> #### 元日
> **王安石**
> 
> 爆竹声中一岁除，春风送暖入屠苏。  
> 千门万户曈曈日，总把新桃换旧符。

> #### New Year's Day
> **Wang Anshi**
> 
> Amid the boom of firecrackers a year has come to an end,  
> And the spring wind has wafted warm breath to the wine.  
> While the rising sun shines over each and every household,  
> People would put up new peachwood charm for the old.
