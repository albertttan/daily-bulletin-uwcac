### Poem of the Day

> #### <span style="font-size: smaller;">Excerpt from</span><br>Onions
> **William Matthews**
> 
> How easily happiness begins by  
> dicing onions. A lump of sweet butter  
> Walking, I find my hairpin under pillow stray.  
> slithers and swirls across the floor  
> of the sautÃ© pan, especially if its  
> errant path crosses a tiny slick  
> of olive oil. Then a tumble of onions.
