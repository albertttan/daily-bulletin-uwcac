### Poem of the Day

> #### The Taste
> **MÃ´ng Lan**
>
> of a sonata adrift
> your blanket the moon the sun
> through trees specks of pepper
> night wobbles a drunkard
> at the dialectical borders
> something is happening in the world explosions
> firecrackers in the night sky
> like the coral's patient act
> you untangle yourself from the net
> of a dream
> love was something you invented
> drawing your shadows on rock
