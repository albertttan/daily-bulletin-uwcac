### Poem of the Day

> #### Hinotama
> **Brandon Shimoda**
>   
> The ball of light rose piteously  
> in the west
> 
> and lingered in space
> 
> Children  
> stood together   after dinner  
> 
> and watched the ball of light pronounce  
> long syllables
> 
> The children were meant to remember it  
> reconnect with it  
> grow old with it,
> 
> grow dreams over  
> the imprint they made  
> of what they left behind
> 
> a bitter yet beautiful  
> endangerment of life
