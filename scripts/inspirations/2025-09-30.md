### Quote of the Day

> Ghorbanat beram is one of those perfect Farsi phrases you canâ€™t quite translate into English. The closest thing is: I would give my life for yours. Sometimes it was just hyperbole.  
> But for Sohrab, it was literal. And it was literal for me too. That is what it means to have a best friend.
