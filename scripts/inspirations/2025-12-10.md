### Poem of the Day

> #### <span style="font-size: smaller;">Excerpt from</span><br>Old Bio in Snow
> **Bianca Stone**
> 
> The year dwindles and glows  
> to December's red jewel,  
> my birth month.  
> 
> The sky blushes,  
> and lays its cheek  
> on the sparkling fields.
> 
> Then dusk swaddles the cattle,  
> their silhouettes  
> simple as faith.
> 
> These nights are gifts,  
> our hands unwrapping the darkness  
> to see what we have.
> 
> The train rushes, ecstatic,  
> to where you are,  
> my bright star.
