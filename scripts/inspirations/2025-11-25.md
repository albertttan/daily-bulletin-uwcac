### Poem of the Day

> #### “Hope” is the thing with feathers
> **Emily Dickinson**
> 
> “Hope” is the thing with feathers –  
> That perches in the soul –  
> And sings the tune without the words –  
> And never stops – at all –
> 
> And sweetest – in the Gale – is heard –  
> And sore must be the storm –  
> That could abash the little Bird  
> That kept so many warm –  
> 
> I’ve heard it in the chillest land –  
> And on the strangest Sea –  
> Yet – never – in Extremity,  
> It asked a crumb – of me.
