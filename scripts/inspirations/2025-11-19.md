### Poem of the Day

> #### Going Home
> **Myles C. Poydras**
>
> &emsp;*After Alice Coltrane*
> 
> an arrangement  
> of trained plucks  
> & then a full-palmed flood  
> of contented ones opens  
> into a siren that isn’t  
> a siren at all  
> 
> but i am invited  
> into dialogue with wordless  
> hallows, a combination blower  
> calling for the quiet of me  
> as it reaches for that hollow place,  
> finding a grainy fulcrum  
> 
> salted from a lower  
> rib of mine, steady  
> like limestone, crusted to  
> the thrums’ pleasure: ancient dialect  
> sung from dunes, all hung up  
> inside, something like home
