### Lyrics of the Day: Pride Month Specials 🏳️‍🌈

> I was just a lonley girl in the eyes of my inner child  
> But I could be anything I want, and no matter where I go  
> You'll always be here in my heart  
> Here in my heart, here in my heart  
> I don't even have to explain  
> Just leave me alone now  
> I can't be held down
