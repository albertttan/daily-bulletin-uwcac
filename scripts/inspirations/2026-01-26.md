### Poem of the Day

> #### Salt Sky
> **Alberto Ríos**
> 
> The bright night sky,  
> Doorway to everything—
> 
> In all that black  
> All those stars:
> 
> Salt.  
> Pinpricks.
> 
> White fireworks.  
> Perlite.
> 
> We look up  
> Pulled into the immensity,
> 
> Lifted into the limitless—  
> As if it were a hole
> 
> We are falling into,  
> Up instead of down.
> 
> We stand on the earth,  
> Breathe in the night.
> 
> It is all too big.  
> We go back inside.
