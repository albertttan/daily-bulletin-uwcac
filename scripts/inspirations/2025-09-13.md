### Poem of the Day

> #### anthem for my belly after eating too much
> **Kara Jackson**
> 
> i look in the mirror, and all the chips i’ve eaten  
> this month have accumulated  
> like schoolwork at the bottom of my tummy,  
> my belly—a country i’m trying to love.  
> my mouth is a lover devoted to you, my belly, my belly  
> the birds will string a song together  
> with wind for you and your army  
> of solids, militia of grease.  
> americans love excess, but we also love jeans,  
> and refuse to make excess comfortable in them.  
> i step into a fashionable prison,  
> my middle managed and fastened into  
> suffering. my gracious gut,  
> dutiful dome, i will wear a house for you  
> that you can live in, promise walls  
> that embrace your growing flesh,  
> and watch you reach toward everything possible.
