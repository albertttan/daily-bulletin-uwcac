### Poem of the Day

> #### How Much?
> **Carl Sandburg**
> 
> How much do you love me, a million bushels?  
> Oh, a lot more than that, Oh, a lot more.
> 
> And tomorrow maybe only half a bushel?  
> Tomorrow maybe not even a half a bushel.
> 
> And is this your heart arithmetic?  
> This is the way the wind measures the weather.
