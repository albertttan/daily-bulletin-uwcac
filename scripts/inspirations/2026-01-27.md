### Poem of the Day

> #### January Poem
> **Suzanne Matson**
> 
 > Only the wrinkle  
 > of a disappearing squirrel  
 > breaks the snow stillness.
 > 
 > The walker, swathed in wool,  
 > lowers toward the prints left  
 > by others, feet that lead to the village.
 > 
 > There a clock stands in front of a closed shop,  
 > its hour not late, though the moon has come early  
 > to mirror the white coin of its frozen face.
