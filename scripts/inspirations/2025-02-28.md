### Tips of the Day

#### Don't Just Do It, Do "This"

Sometimes when we get overly ambitious, we tend to list a wide range of goals and steps. However, once you make you hit a hard task, you might be prone to distractions and procrastination.

The real secret in long-term success is neither an inspirational slogan like “just do it”, nor a step-by-step plan. It's taking consistent actions, day-after-day, week-after-week, month-after-month. Every day, your new action needs to build on the momentum from your past actions, and you flow faster and faster towards your goal.

This day, try challenging yourself with some repeatable things. Instead of saying "I will read books and become knowledgeable." Try set a goal like: "I will read 20 minutes every day before bed" and see how it goes!
