### Poem of the Day

> #### Sonnet 5
> **William Shakespeare**
>
> Those hours, that with gentle work did frame  
> The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,  
> Will play the tyrants to the very same,  
> And that un-fair which fairly doth excel:
>
> For never-resting Time leads summer on  
> To hideous winter, and confounds him there,  
> Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,  
> Beauty o’er-snowed and bareness everywhere.
>
> Then, were not summer’s distillation left  
> A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,  
> Beauty’s effect with beauty were bereft,  
> Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.
>
> But flowers distilled, though they with winter meet,  
> Lose but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
