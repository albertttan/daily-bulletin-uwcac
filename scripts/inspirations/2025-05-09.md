### Poem of the Day

> #### End of a Journey
> **Suphil Lee Park**
>
> Across the plain, flat  
> joy a boat sails.  
> Though many have before,  
> this one draws a simple line  
> on water for which I love it.  
> Its journey ends at a pine  
> thatâ€™s been standing  
> all this time alone.  
> You look for another  
> by which the pine must  
> have stood, which I understand  
> has nothing to do with truth.  
> Yes, you have lost  
> too. I see that now.
