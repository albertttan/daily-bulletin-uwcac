> #### Having a Great Time Being Transgender in America Lately  
> **Jackie Sabbagh**
>
> It is day infinity  
> of everyone wanting me dead. People are having fun  
> bringing lemon squares and automatic artillery to the anti-trans community meetings.  
> Divorced legislators harangue  
> about pedophile cults and surgeried infants and what ever happened to forever ago.  
> I am more beautiful than you and I would like to be loved.  
> I am getting concerned  
> about the monomaniacs who make their entire lives about deadnaming and transvestigations:  
> obviously it’s working but aren’t you exhausted, don’t you remember  
> when someone loved you without knowing what you were?  
> I am eating shortbread on a patio table overlooking the enormous green ocean.  
> Somewhere an octopus is being eaten by an octopus and not panicking.  
> Black dress to the floor, red acrylic nails, silver teardrop earrings, waterproof mascara.  
> I am excited to do this for the rest of my life and be terrified.  
> I hear a noise behind me and I don’t turn around.
