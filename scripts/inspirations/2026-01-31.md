### Poem of the Day

> #### I look at the world
> **Langston Hughes**
> 
> I look at the world  
> From awakening eyes in a black face—  
> And this is what I see:  
> This fenced-off narrow space  
> Assigned to me.
> 
> I look then at the silly walls  
> Through dark eyes in a dark face—  
> And this is what I know:  
> That all these walls oppression builds  
> Will have to go!
> 
> I look at my own body  
> With eyes no longer blind—  
> And I see that my own hands can make  
> The world that's in my mind.  
> Then let us hurry, comrades,  
> The road to find.
