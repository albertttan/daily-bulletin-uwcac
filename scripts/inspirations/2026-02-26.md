### Poem of the Day

> #### Oxford
> **Benjamin Rosenbaum**
>   
> I am in love with you, strange city:  
> Not for your silver tusk of moon,  
> Or golden nuggets in the sky;  
> Nor for the old wind-woman's croon;
>   
> Not for your spiders weaving fog  
> From wall to street, and street to stream;  
> Not even for your Magdalen Tower  
> Touching the clouds, a sculptured dream.
>   
> I am in love with you, strange city,  
> For you stir in your valley lands  
> Quietly as a woman's eyes.  
> Patiently as a woman's hands.
