### Poem of the Day

> #### Kumukanda
> **Kayo Chingonyi**
> 
> Since I haven’t danced among my fellow initiates,  
> following a looped processions from woods at the edge  
> of a village, Tata’s people would think me unfinished –  
> a child who never sloughed off the childish estate  
> to cross the river boys of our tribe must cross  
> in order to die and come back grown.
>
> I was raised in a strange land, by small increments:  
> when I bathed my mother the days she was too weak,  
> when auntie broke the news and I chose a yellow suit  
> and white shoes to dress my mother’s body,  
> at the grave-side when the man I almost grew to call  
> dad, though we both needed a hug, shook my hand.
>
> If my alternate self, who never left, could see me  
> what would he make of these literary pretensions,  
> this need to speak with a tongue that isn’t mine?  
> Would he be strange to me as I to him, frowning  
> as he greets me in the language of my father  
> and my father’s father and my father’s father’s father?
