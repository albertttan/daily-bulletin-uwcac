### Poem of the Day

> #### If You Come Softly
> **Audre Lorde**
> 
> If you come as softly  
> As the wind within the trees  
> You may hear what I hear  
> See what sorrow sees.
> 
> If you come as lightly  
> As threading dew  
> I will take you gladly  
> Nor ask more of you.
> 
> You may sit beside me  
> Silent as a breath  
> Only those who stay dead  
> Shall remember death.
> 
> And if you come I will be silent  
> Nor speak harsh words to you.  
> I will not ask you why now.  
> Or how, or what you do.
> 
> We shall sit here, softly  
> Beneath two different years  
> And the rich between us  
> Shall drink our tears.
