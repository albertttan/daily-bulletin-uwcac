> The day is winter bright. I blink against it.  
> Each time the sun glints in my eyes,  
> each time I close my lids & let them go
> 
> orange & freckled with light,  
> my mind files it into a folder  
> that contains every other time
> 
> it’s happened before: folders nested  
> inside folders going back, I imagine,  
> to one morning standing in my crib,
> 
> waiting for my mother to reach down  
> & lift me out, the sun keeping me  
> company until her arms appeared.
> 
> In the file: sun, sun_2, sun_3,  
> sun_75, sun_700. Each a document  
> I can return to & open, even revising
> 
> old experience with new thinking.  
> As if the eye has its own memory—  
> not *the mind’s eye* but *the eye’s mind*—
> 
> cataloging material it claims as its own.  
> Cataloging as long as I live. Sun_7000,  
> sun_final, sun_final_revised, sun_final_final.
