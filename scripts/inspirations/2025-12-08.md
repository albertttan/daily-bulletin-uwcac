> There’s always a snowstorm coming  
> and I’m always booked at a café  
> on the other side of the mountain  
> driving on bald tires to give another lecture  
> on Hegel’s vision  
> of the infinite whole  
> and at the last minute deciding to lecture on wind,  
> and snow, and their effects on discarded newspapers.  
> No, wait—this lecture  
> was about repeating the past.  
>   
> There’s always a snowstorm coming  
> and I’m always booked at a café  
> on the other side of the mountain  
> driving in the dark  
> and I am insanely happy,  
> weaving along the winding cliffs,  
> careening down the other side of the summit  
> in a little blue car, parking, sliding a quarter in a meter  
> and bouncing off with manila folders under my arm,  
> my gabardine overcoat  
> flapping open like a hospital gown,  
> to give lectures on vision and snow and repeating the past.
