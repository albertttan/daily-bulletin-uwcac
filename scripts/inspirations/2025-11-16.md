### Poem of the Day

> #### Fall, leaves, fall
> **Emily Brontë**
> 
> Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;  
> Lengthen night and shorten day;  
> Every leaf speaks bliss to me  
> Fluttering from the autumn tree.  
> I shall smile when wreaths of snow  
> Blossom where the rose should grow;  
> I shall sing when night’s decay  
> Ushers in a drearier day.
