### Poem of the Day

> #### Rogue Corn
> **Nikki Wallschlaeger**
> 
> My fav event as harvest season approaches  
> is the rough seed that escaped the plots.
> 
> If there’s a cornfield adjacent to another bed  
> of vegetables, you can count on imperfection,
> 
> you can see stalks standing where they’re  
> not supposed to be, the winds have ideas,
> 
> seeds who choose wildness, here they are,  
> with red potatoes, alfalfa, peas, sunflowers,
> 
> they look pleased w/ themselves, outfoxing  
> clever farmers, making it to the unplanned
> 
> ground where nobody is around, recovering  
> where the amiable dirt will welcome them.
> 
> Seeds are so <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">fun</span> and <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">determined</span>,  
> there’s no concept of liberty, no need for it,
> 
> guaranteed if I were a seedling I’d abstain,  
> you know I would, I’d find a way to renounce
> 
> what’s expected of my common name,  
> gliding over the roads until a dream takes root
