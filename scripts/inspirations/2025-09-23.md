### Poem of the Day

> #### Rogue Corn
> **Nikki Wallschlaeger**
> 
> &emsp;&emsp;The grasses are light brown  
> &emsp;&emsp;and the ocean comes in  
> &emsp;&emsp;long shimmering lines  
> &emsp;&emsp;under the fleet from last night  
> &emsp;&emsp;which dozes now in the early morning
> 
> Here and there horses graze  
> &emsp;&emsp;on somebody’s acreage
> 
> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Strangely, it was not my desire
> 
> that bade me speak in church to be released  
> &emsp;but memory of the way it used to be in  
> careless and exotic play
> 
> &emsp;&emsp;when characters were promises  
> &emsp;then recognitions.  The world of transformation  
> is real and not real but trusting.
> 
> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Enough of these lessons?  I mean  
> didactic phrases to take you in and out of  
> love’s mysterious bonds?
> 
> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Well I myself am not myself
> 
> &emsp;and which power of survival I speak  
> for is not made of houses.
> 
> &emsp;It is inner luxury, of golden figures  
> that breathe like mountains do  
> &emsp;&emsp;and whose skin is made dusky by stars.
