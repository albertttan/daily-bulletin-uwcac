### Poem of the Day

> #### Flight
> **Sarah Westcott**
> 
> If love was like clouds and I leapt  
> from the plane, could I fall into you?  
> Could you bear me softly like faith,
> 
> muss my shadow with woolly devotion,  
> fold me into your core, where I could not feel  
> the rush of grave air?  
> Would you blind me, temporarily, please?
> 
> Let me glean this when I unbuckle, head for the exit:  
> your turning mass like milk in the belly,  
> your lack of certainty, the way your edges furl –
> 
> Or let me make my own cloud  
> here on the pane – let me hush you into an oval window  
> wipe a line through my breath with a finger  
> as if proving I have agency over love, and water and air.
