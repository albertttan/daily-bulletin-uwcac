### Lyrics of the Day

> Sun drops falling everywhere  
> Walking through an orange blossom blizzard in the air  
> Springtime, slip around the bend  
> See the summer berries, dark and heavy on their stems  
> Morning, yawn yourself awake  
> The light of the dawn brings another day to make  
> Season songs I'll sing you when  
> I kiss you goodbye until "Hello again"
