### Poem of the Day

> #### Black Cherries
> **W. S. Merwin**
> 
> Late in May as the light lengthens  
> toward summer the young goldfinches  
> flutter down through the day for the first time  
> to find themselves among fallen petals  
> cradling their day's colors in the day's shadows  
> of the garden beside the old house  
> after a cold spring with no rain  
> not a sound comes from the empty village  
> as I stand eating the black cherries  
> from the loaded branches above me  
> saying to myself Remember this
