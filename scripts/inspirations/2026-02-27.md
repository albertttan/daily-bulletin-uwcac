> I love what I see because one day.  
> &emsp;I will cease to see it.  
> &emsp;And simply because it is.  
> In this placid interval in which I feel my existence,  
> &emsp;More because I love than because I am,  
> &emsp;I love both everything and myself.  
> They could give me nothing better were they to return,  
> &emsp;Those primitive gods,   
> &emsp;Who also know nothing.
