### Poem of the Day

> #### <span style="font-size: smaller;">Excerpt from</span><br>Away Melancholy
> **Stevie Smith**
>
> Man aspires  
> To good,  
> To love  
> Sighs;
>
> Beaten, corrupted, dying  
> In his own blood lying  
> Yet heaves up an eye above  
> Cries, Love, love.  
> It is his virtue needs explaining,  
> Not his failing.
>
> Away, melancholy,  
> Away with it, let it go.
