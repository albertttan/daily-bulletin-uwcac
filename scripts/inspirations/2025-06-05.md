### Quote of the Day: Pride Month Specials 🏳️‍🌈

> It's easy to forget you're trans. Or maybe a better way to word it would be, it gets easier for me to forget the pain of being trans. Being transgender is who you are, and the pain is what the outside does to you. The pain is what happens when you and the world go for each other's throats. \[...\] I almost forget that being trans can hurt.
