			The Daily Bulletin project creates Daily Bulletins to be delivered by email every day to students of UWC Atlantic College, providing wellbeing inspirations and helpful information.
		</p>
		<p>
			The project is a proposal submitted to and implemented by the Wellbeing Council of UWC Atlantic College, aimed at improving student wellbeing and increasing the exposure of the council. <!--See more in the <a href="acknowledgements/">Acknowledgements</a> page.-->

			The Daily Bulletin project at UWC Atlantic College, which started in February 2025 and is expected to launch in March, is a continuation of <a href="https://albertttan.github.io/daily-bulletin/">the Daily Bulletin project at YK Pao School</a>, which was launched in November 2023 before being partially discontinued since June 2024.
